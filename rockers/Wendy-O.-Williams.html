    <p>I don't believe that people should take their own lives without deep and thoughtful reflection over a considerable period of time. I do believe strongly, however, that the right to do so is one of the most fundamental rights that anyone in a free society should have. For me, much of the world makes no sense, but my feelings about what I am doing ring loud and clear to an inner ear and a place where there is no self, only calm.
       - Wendy O. Williams

    <p>Her life had settled into a permanent Sunday: it was all over except the feeling that it was all over.</p>

    <p>Yes, she did tell me. I spent the better part of four years trying to dissuade her, or at least postpone it. Anger, in any case for someone who takes this ultimate step, is not something I would readily understand. Utterly deep and inexpressible grief and loss. But anger no. I will tell you that while she was here she lived with an authenticity that few can rival, and this, I think was a goal in life she set with a determination at a young age. Despite remarkable hurdles, I believe she achieved this goal. Her work and her legacy speaks for itself.

    <p>She was working out in a gym full of guys at a time when such a thought was anathema to women. She was a strict vegetarian and animal rights activist before it was fashionable. She railed against rampant materialism and often said that her act was about exorcising the evil in society. She preferred style to fashion, asserting that fashion was about “following” and style was about being yourself. She drove her point home by cutting her hair into a mohawk which was rarely seen, and never on a woman. None of this might seem to be groundbreaking in this day and age, but if you ask anyone who was on the scene back then, artist or fan, you’ll find out just how radical it was at the time.
